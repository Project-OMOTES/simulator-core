Solver pipe class
++++++++++++++++++++++++
The pipe class is a solver asset that represents a pipe in the network. It is used to calculate the 
flow in the pipe and the pressure drop across the pipe. It is derived from the fall type class and 
extended with the heat loss over the pipeline. The heat loss is calculated based on the actual 
physical properties of the pipe.
