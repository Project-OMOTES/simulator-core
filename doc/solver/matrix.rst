Matrix class
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The matrix class stores the matrix of the system of equations. It is used to solve the system of 
equations. The user can add unknowns to the matrix, and the matrix solver will then pass the index 
in the matrix back. This index should be used in creating equation objects. For solving, the 
standard matrix solver available in `numpy`_ is used.
