Consumer asset
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The **Consumer Asset** represents components that consume energy.

This asset is stored within the `DemandCluster` class in the 
`omotes_simulator_core.entities.assets.demand_cluster` module.

A consumer asset is initialized with an asset name, a unique asset ID, and a list of connected port IDs. 
Values are set for different parameters that include as internal diameter, supply and return temperatures, 
pressure input, thermal power allocation, and mass flow rate.

The `set_setpoints` method ensures that required setpointsâ€”supply temperature, return temperature, and heat 
demand are provided before adjusting the thermal power allocation and computing the mass flow rate accordingly. 
This calculated data is then passed to the `solver_asset` instance for further use in simulations.
